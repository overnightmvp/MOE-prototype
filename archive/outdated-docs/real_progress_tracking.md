# How to Track Real Progress: From Artifacts to Reality

## **What the Artifacts Actually Are**

### **üìÑ Documentation Artifacts (Static)**
- **Simplified PRD Strategy** - Your actual product blueprint
- **Sequential Action Sheet** - Your execution roadmap  
- **Agentic Automation Framework** - Your agent orchestration plan

### **üé≠ Visual Mockups (Simulated)**
- **Launch Terminal Display** - Shows what a real monitoring dashboard might look like
- **Progress visualization** - Demonstrates the concept, but doesn't track real systems

**The artifacts are your strategic foundation, but you need to build the actual systems.**

---

## **How to Turn Artifacts into Real Systems**

### **Step 1: Set Up Real Tracking Infrastructure**

#### **A. Create a Simple Progress Dashboard**
```bash
# Option 1: Simple Notion Database
1. Create Notion page called "AI Product Strategist Progress"
2. Add database with columns:
   - Task Name
   - Status (Not Started/In Progress/Complete)
   - Owner (TechOps/ContentOps/CustomerOps/DataOps)
   - Due Date
   - Notes
   - Blockers

# Option 2: Google Sheets Dashboard
1. Create sheet: "Launch Progress Tracker"
2. Tabs: Daily Tasks | Metrics | Customer Feedback | Revenue
3. Use conditional formatting for status colors
4. Add charts for key metrics
```

#### **B. Set Up Real Analytics**
```bash
# Required Tools:
- Google Analytics 4 (free)
- Google Search Console (free)  
- Gumroad analytics (built-in)
- Simple email tool (Mailchimp/ConvertKit)
```
