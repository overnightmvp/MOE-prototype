# Claude Code Deployment Guide
**Automate Your GitHub + Netlify Setup with Claude Code**

---

## **What Claude Code Can Do for You**

Claude Code can handle all the terminal commands, file creation, and Git operations automatically. Here's what it can automate:

### ✅ **Fully Automated Tasks:**
- Create and initialize Git repository
- Generate all project files (HTML, netlify.toml, README, etc.)
- Commit and push to GitHub
- Set up proper folder structure
- Configure deployment settings

### ⚠️ **Requires Your Input:**
- GitHub repository creation (web interface)
- Netlify account connection (web interface)
- Domain setup (if using custom domain)

---

## **Step 1: Set Up Claude Code Access**

### **Prerequisites:**
- Claude Code installed and configured
- Git configured with your GitHub credentials
- GitHub account ready

### **Verify Setup:**
```bash
# Test if Claude Code can access your system
claude-code --version

# Test Git access
git --version
git config --list | grep user
```

---

## **Step 2: Claude Code Automation Commands**

### **Full Project Setup (Single Command):**

```bash
# Let Claude Code create everything for you
claude-code "Create a complete GitHub repository for my landing page project called '100k-test-landing' with the following requirements:

1. Initialize a new Git repository in a folder called '100k-test-landing'
2. Create index.html with the complete landing page code that includes:
   - Google Analytics tracking ID: G-VTN9BMLLW1
   - Gumroad product URL: https://toshioj.gumroad.com/l/overnightmvp
   - Netlify domain: https://majestic-naiad-472ef2.netlify.app/
3. Create netlify.toml with proper configuration for static site deployment
4. Create _redirects file with buy/purchase shortcuts to Gumroad
5. Create a professional README.md explaining the project
6. Set up proper folder structure with assets/css, assets/js, assets/images
7. Add all files to git and create initial commit
8. Show me the commands to push to GitHub when I'm ready

Make this production-ready and include all the optimizations from the landing page artifact."
```

### **Alternative: Step-by-Step Automation**

If you prefer more control, use these individual commands:

```bash
# 1. Project Initialization
claude-code "Create a new directory called '100k-test-landing', initialize git, and set up the basic project structure with folders for assets/css, assets/js, and assets/images"

# 2. Generate Landing Page
claude-code "Create an index.html file with a complete conversion-optimized landing page for 'The $100k Test' product. Include Google Analytics ID G-VTN9BMLLW1, Gumroad URL https://toshioj.gumroad.com/l/overnightmvp, and make it mobile-responsive with proper SEO meta tags."

# 3. Create Configuration Files
claude-code "Create netlify.toml and _redirects files for optimal Netlify deployment with security headers, caching, and redirect rules for /buy and /purchase to the Gumroad URL"

# 4. Git Setup
claude-code "Add all files to git, create an initial commit with message 'Initial landing page setup - production ready', and show me the commands to connect to GitHub remote"
```

## **Step 3: Execute the Automation**

### **Run the Claude Code Command:**

1. **Open your terminal**
2. **Navigate to where you want the project folder**
3. **Run the full automation command** from Step 2
4. **Claude Code will:**
   - Create all necessary files
   - Set up the project structure
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Prepare everything for GitHub

### **Expected Output:**
```
✅ Created directory: 100k-test-landing
✅ Initialized Git repository
✅ Created index.html with production-ready landing page
✅ Created netlify.toml with deployment configuration
✅ Created _redirects with URL shortcuts
✅ Created README.md with project documentation
✅ Set up assets folder structure
✅ Added all files to Git
✅ Created initial commit

Next steps:
1. Create GitHub repository at: https://github.com/new
2. Run: git remote add origin [your-repo-url]
3. Run: git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Step 4: Connect to GitHub (Manual)**

**Claude Code will show you these commands to run:**

```bash
# After creating your GitHub repo at github.com/new
cd 100k-test-landing
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/100k-test-landing.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Step 5: Automate Netlify Connection**

### **Claude Code Can Help With:**

```bash
# Generate Netlify configuration and deployment instructions
claude-code "Create step-by-step instructions for connecting my GitHub repository '100k-test-landing' to Netlify, including the exact settings for build configuration and custom domain setup"
```

**This will generate:**
- Exact Netlify configuration steps
- Build settings for your project
- Domain configuration instructions
- SSL setup guidance
