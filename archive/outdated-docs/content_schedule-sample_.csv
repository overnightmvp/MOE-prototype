131,X,Thread,The 'hustle harder' mantra is silently killing your product.,"You've been told to hustle, to grind, to work 18-hour days. But what if that relentless effort is actually distracting you from building smart, not just building more?

The truth is, unstructured hustle often leads to:
‚Ä¢ Burnout before you see results
‚Ä¢ Wasted effort on unvalidated ideas  
‚Ä¢ A product no one actually wants
‚Ä¢ Analysis paralysis disguised as ""research""

Sustainable success comes from strategic planning and ruthless prioritization, not just sheer volume of work.

Stop blindly hustling. Build with purpose and clarity.

They built for themselves, not their customers.

üßµ Thread on how to avoid this trap:

1/ The ""I would use this"" trap
Just because YOU have a problem doesn't mean it's a MARKET problem.

2/ Signs you're building for yourself:
‚Ä¢ You're the only beta tester
‚Ä¢ Friends/family are your target market  
‚Ä¢ You haven't talked to strangers about it

3/ How to escape this:
‚Ä¢ Interview 10 people outside your network
‚Ä¢ Ask about their current solutions
‚Ä¢ Listen more than you pitch

4/ The magic question:
""How are you solving this problem today?""

If they say ""I'm not"" or ""I just deal with it"" - you might not have a real problem.

5/ Build for a market, not for yourself.

Your product should solve THEIR problem, not yours.

üßµ My exact framework:

1/ The 5-Minute Market Size Check
‚Ä¢ Google: ""[your solution] market size""
‚Ä¢ If it's under $1B, might be too small
‚Ä¢ If it's over $100B, might be too saturated

2/ The ""Already Exists"" Test
‚Ä¢ Search for direct competitors
‚Ä¢ 0 competitors = no market
‚Ä¢ 100+ competitors = too crowded
‚Ä¢ 3-10 competitors = sweet spot

3/ The Reddit Reality Check
‚Ä¢ Find relevant subreddits
‚Ä¢ Search for your problem keywords
‚Ä¢ Are people actively complaining?
‚Ä¢ Are they paying for bad solutions?

4/ The LinkedIn Validation
‚Ä¢ Search for your target customers
‚Ä¢ Send 10 connection requests
‚Ä¢ Ask: ""What's your biggest challenge with [problem]?""

5/ The MVP Landing Page
‚Ä¢ Build in 2 hours with basic tools
‚Ä¢ Drive traffic with $50 ad spend
‚Ä¢ Track email signups (aim for 5%+ conversion)

6/ The ""Would You Pay?"" Test
‚Ä¢ Email your signups
‚Ä¢ Describe your solution
‚Ä¢ Ask: ""Would you pay $X for this?""

143,X,Thread,3 questions that reveal if your product will succeed.,"3 questions that reveal if your product will succeed:

üßµ The brutal truth test:

1/ ""How much would you pay to solve this problem?""

If they hesitate or say ""I don't know""... red flag.

People know exactly how much their problems cost them.

A founder struggling with product strategy? They know they're losing $10K/month on wrong features.

2/ ""What are you using now to solve this?""

If they say ""nothing"" or ""I just deal with it""... bigger red flag.

No current solution usually means no real problem.

The best products replace existing (expensive/painful) solutions.

3/ ""When was the last time this problem cost you money/time?""

If they can't give a specific recent example... biggest red flag.

Vague problems get vague solutions that nobody buys.

Your product should solve yesterday's problem, not someday's problem.

The pattern: Real problems have real costs, real solutions, and real urgency.
