# Global Git Commit Rule

## Automatic Post-Commit Actions

**RULE: After every git commit, automatically execute `/compact` command with these actions:**

### 1. Conversation Summary
- Summarize conversation context and retain only key points needed for next steps
- Remove unnecessary historical details and focus on current objectives
- Maintain critical technical decisions and implementation details

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Update `customer_journey_blueprint.md` with latest changes
- Follow s-tier quality standards and token optimization best practices
- Be brutally honest about cutting unnecessary work and complexity
- Keep all documentation concise and efficient

### 3. Token Optimization Rules
- **Eliminate redundancy**: Remove duplicate information across files
- **Prioritize clarity**: Use clear, direct language without fluff
- **Focus on essentials**: Only document what's needed for customization/setup
- **Maintain quality**: Never sacrifice technical accuracy for brevity

### 4. Legacy Task Completion Rule
**RULE: Every time a task in TodoWrite is marked as "completed", automatically prompt for a git commit.**

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Manual Reminder**: When marking tasks complete, Claude Code will automatically:
   - Stage relevant files with `git add`
   - Suggest a commit message based on the completed task
   - Execute `git commit` with detailed description
   - Push changes to remote repository

2. **Commit Message Format**:
```
feat: [task description]

[Task details and implementation notes]

TaskMaster: Completed task [ID] - [description]
```

### 5. Quality Standards
- S-tier project organization
- Consistent file structure
- Clear URL hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load for users
- Easy customization and repurposing
