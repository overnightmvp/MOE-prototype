## **Step 3: Add Your Landing Page Code (5 minutes)**

### **3.1 Create index.html**
Copy the complete landing page code from the previous artifact and paste it into `index.html`.

<meta property="og:url" content="https://100k-test.netlify.app">

<!-- Replace GA_TRACKING_ID with your actual ID: -->
gtag('config', 'YOUR_ACTUAL_GA_ID');

<!-- Replace Gumroad URLs (2 places): -->
<a href="https://gumroad.com/l/YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCT_URL" class="cta-button">
```

### **3.2 Create netlify.toml**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  command = "echo 'No build process needed for static HTML'"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"

# Redirect old URLs if needed (add as you grow)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/old-page"
  to = "/new-page"
  status = 301

# Netlify forms (for email capture)
[[forms]]
  name = "email-signup"
```

### **3.3 Create _redirects**

/buy https://gumroad.com/l/YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCT_URL 301
/purchase https://gumroad.com/l/YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCT_URL 301

# Handle 404s
/* /index.html 200
