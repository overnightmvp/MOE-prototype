# Git Commit Rule for Task Completion

## Global Rule Implementation

**RULE: Every time a task in TodoWrite is marked as "completed", automatically prompt for a git commit.**

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Manual Reminder**: When marking tasks complete, Claude Code will automatically:
   - Stage relevant files with `git add`
   - Suggest a commit message based on the completed task
   - Execute `git commit` with detailed description
   - Push changes to remote repository

2. **Commit Message Format**:
```
feat: [task description]

[Task details and implementation notes]

TaskMaster: Completed task [ID] - [description]
```

3. **Automated Workflow**:
- Task completion → File staging → Commit creation → Repository push
- Ensures every completed task creates a traceable git history
- Maintains project consistency and progress tracking

### Example Implementation

When task is completed:
```bash
# Auto-execute:
git add [relevant-files]
git commit -m "feat: [task-description]

[implementation details]

TaskMaster: Completed task [id] - [description]"
git push origin main
```

This rule ensures complete traceability of all project changes and maintains clean git history.
